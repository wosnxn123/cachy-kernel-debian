# CachyOS Kernel Debian Builder

This repository contains a GitHub Actions workflow for building the latest
CachyOS Linux kernel as installable Debian packages.

The workflow is intended for Debian-based desktop systems where you want to test
or run a CachyOS-flavored kernel without manually maintaining the full build
toolchain on your machine.

## What It Builds

The workflow fetches the newest kernel metadata from the official
[CachyOS/linux-cachyos](https://github.com/CachyOS/linux-cachyos) packaging
repository, downloads the matching CachyOS kernel source tarball, applies a
Debian-oriented desktop configuration pass, compiles the kernel, and packages the
result with the kernel's upstream Debian packaging target.

Expected output includes standard `.deb` packages such as:

- `linux-image-*.deb`
- `linux-headers-*.deb`
- related generated kernel packages produced by `make bindeb-pkg`
- `BUILD-MANIFEST.txt` with source/version details and SHA256 checksums

## Workflow Trigger

The workflow is manual-only.

It does not run on pushes, pull requests, tags, or a schedule. A repository
maintainer must explicitly start it from the GitHub Actions tab with the
`workflow_dispatch` trigger.

## Manual Usage

1. Open the repository on GitHub.
2. Go to **Actions**.
3. Select **Build CachyOS Kernel Debian Packages**.
4. Click **Run workflow**.
5. Choose the desired inputs:
   - `kernel_variant`: CachyOS package variant to build.
   - `cpu_scheduler`: scheduler/config flavor.
   - `run_qemu_smoke_test`: whether to boot-test the built kernel in QEMU.
6. Wait for the build to finish.
7. Download the generated artifacts from the workflow run.

Kernel builds are large and slow. A full run can take several hours and uses a
significant amount of GitHub-hosted runner disk space.

## Available Build Inputs

### `kernel_variant`

Supported values:

- `linux-cachyos`
- `linux-cachyos-bore`
- `linux-cachyos-eevdf`
- `linux-cachyos-lts`

The default is `linux-cachyos`.

### `cpu_scheduler`

Supported values:

- `cachyos`
- `bore`
- `eevdf`

The default is `cachyos`.

### `run_qemu_smoke_test`

When enabled, the workflow extracts the generated kernel image package, creates a
minimal BusyBox initramfs, and boots the kernel with QEMU. The test passes only
if the guest reaches the init process and prints a success marker on the serial
console.

The default is enabled for manual runs.

## Desktop-Oriented Kernel Configuration

The workflow starts from the CachyOS kernel configuration and then ensures common
Debian desktop requirements are available. The configuration pass includes
support for:

- initramfs booting
- loadable kernel modules
- EFI systems
- dynamic preemption and high-resolution timers
- schedutil CPU frequency governor
- common cgroups, BPF, and pressure-stall interfaces
- Intel, AMD, Nouveau, and VirtIO graphics modules
- common USB, HID, audio, webcam, Bluetooth, and Wi-Fi modules
- common filesystems such as ext4, Btrfs, XFS, F2FS, exFAT, NTFS3, NFS, CIFS,
  OverlayFS, and SquashFS
- KVM, VirtIO, and VFIO modules
- WireGuard and common networking features

The build uses a generic x86-64 target so the resulting packages are more
portable across Debian-based machines.

## Validation

The workflow performs package validation before uploading artifacts:

- verifies that `.deb` files were produced
- verifies that image and header packages exist
- inspects packages with `dpkg-deb`
- runs `lintian --fail-on error`
- checks for a packaged `vmlinuz-*`
- checks for packaged kernel modules
- checks for installed header files
- optionally performs a minimal QEMU boot smoke test

## Release Assets

Artifacts are always uploaded to the workflow run.

If a maintainer manually runs the workflow against a tag ref, the workflow can
also publish the generated `.deb` packages and `BUILD-MANIFEST.txt` as GitHub
Release assets.

## Installing Packages

Download the generated `.deb` files from the workflow artifacts, then install the
image and headers on a Debian-based system:

```bash
sudo apt install ./linux-image-*.deb ./linux-headers-*.deb
sudo update-grub
sudo reboot
```

After rebooting, confirm the running kernel:

```bash
uname -a
```

Keep a known-good distribution kernel installed so you can select it from the
bootloader if the custom kernel does not work on your hardware.

## Important Notes

- This project repackages CachyOS kernel sources for Debian-based systems; it is
  not an official CachyOS project.
- CachyOS kernel sources and packaging metadata come from upstream CachyOS
  repositories at build time.
- Kernel compatibility depends on your hardware, firmware, bootloader, Secure
  Boot configuration, DKMS modules, and distribution release.
- Secure Boot users may need to sign the generated kernel or disable Secure Boot,
  depending on local policy.
- Proprietary or out-of-tree modules, such as NVIDIA DKMS modules, are not built
  by this workflow.

The workflow is self-contained and fetches the CachyOS kernel sources during the
GitHub Actions run.
